# About

This is a forum created with TypeScript and React, in the early stages of development.

You can create posts and comments which persist, and view them in the UI.

The app loads a page that asks for a 'title' and 'content'.

After you enter text and press the button, it will display the title and comment, as in a forum, in descending order down the page.

## How To Run

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.
